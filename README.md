### Final assignment prior to LC101 graduation

Although not entirely coded by myself, this project is a good example of the concepts and information that was taught during the 12 week Java course. 

Some of the highlights of this project are:
- use of thymeleaf templates, fragments, static sources, and data transfer
- utilization of MVC framework
- wiring for MySQL database connections
